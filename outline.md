# What is Raidable Claims? #
### The goal of Raidable Claims is to create a chunk claiming system that works smoothly in a PvP environment ###

## How does it work? ##
Over time, players will accumulate a resource called **power**. Power can be increased in ways such as killing other players or play time and decreased when you are killed by players.

At a certain power level, players will be able to create their own team or faction. Any level of power can join a faction, which contributes to the faction's **total power**.

A player or a faction's total power dictates their ability to claim chunks and their **territory** size, but first they will need to place their *(name pending)* **Claim Center**.

## Claim Center ##
The Claim Center is a block that allows nearby territory to be claimed, claim blocks should be used to protect this vital block.

## Territory ##
Based on a faction's power, territory acts as reserved land that can be claimed by the owning faction. Other players or factions cannot claim this area.
Players that enter this area will be notified that they are residing in another faction's territory.

## Raiding ##
Raiding is a large part of Raidable Claims, it's even in the name. Raiding is the act of breaking into another faction's territory and stealing their resources.

A raid can be initiated by placing a **Raid Beacon** in the territory of another faction. The beacon will notify the faction members and starts to count down until the raid begins.

Once the raid begins, the raiders will have a limited amount of time to break into the faction's base and steal their resources. If the raiders are successful, they will be rewarded with a portion of the faction's power.

Raiders can stand in the raid zone of the Claim Block or use explosives on claimed area to deal damage to its associated Claim Block.

After the conclusion of a raid, the defenders will have a 24-hour grace period where they cannot be raided again by the same faction or its allies.

## Claim Block ##
Claim Blocks can be chained such that a "claimed" Claim Block will not take damage until the "claiming" Claim Block is destroyed. This allows for multiple lines of defense to be set up.

Claim Blocks can be repaired by the owning faction, but only if they are not currently being raided.
